My adventures in Python.

Jupyter Lab:
I highly recommend you to download and use Jupyter Lab on your Windows PC.
Jupyter Lab is a very user-friendly and fun way to use Python (as compared to directly using PowerShell).
After you have downloaded Jupyter Lab, running it is very easy:

-In File Explorer, go to the folder containing all the stuff you will be working with

-In the address bar of this folder, delete the default address, and type "powershell", and press enter

-In the PowerShell window which opens up, type in "jupyter-lab"

-If Jupyter Lab has been installed on your PC, then it should run properly now!
