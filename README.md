My adventures in Python.

If you want to learn this language from scratch, then see the [Python Programming](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Python_Programming) WikiBook.


## Interactive mode ##

In PowerShell, if you type in `python -i hello.py`, then you will enter the interactive mode of Python.

This is good for playing around. 

## Jupyter Lab ##

I highly recommend you to download and use Jupyter Lab on your Windows PC.
Jupyter Lab is a very user-friendly and fun way to use Python (as compared to directly using PowerShell).
After you have downloaded Jupyter Lab, running it is very easy:

1. In File Explorer, go to your folder of interest (your Python playground!)
2. In the address bar of this folder, delete the default address, and type `powershell`, and press enter
3. In the PowerShell window which opens up, type in `jupyter-lab`, and press enter
4. If Jupyter Lab has been installed on your PC, then one or more URLs will be provided to you
4. Copy and paste one of these URLs into Chrome's address bar, and press enter. Jupyter Lab will run now!

Search around on [jupyter.org](https://jupyter.org/) or Google or YouTube if you want to learn more about how to use this wonderful software, 
or if you are having trouble setting it up.
