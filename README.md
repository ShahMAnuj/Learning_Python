My adventures in Python.

Jupyter Lab:
I highly recommend you to download and use Jupyter Lab on your Windows PC.
Jupyter Lab is a very user-friendly and fun way to use Python (as compared to directly using PowerShell).
After you have downloaded Jupyter Lab, running it is very easy:

1. In File Explorer, go to the folder containing all the stuff you will be working with
2. In the address bar of this folder, delete the default address, and type "powershell", and press enter
3. In the PowerShell window which opens up, type in "jupyter-lab"
4. If Jupyter Lab has been installed on your PC, then it should run properly now!

Search around on https://jupyter.org/ or Google or YouTube if you want to learn more about how to use this wonderful software, 
or if you are having trouble setting it up.
