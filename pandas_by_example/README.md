Pandas by Example:

When I first started learning about Pandas via Coursera, I found the amount of code to be overwhelming. So many different names, keywords, methods, features, etc etc to remember. But now, I think I have come to the ideal method: forget trying to rote learn all the stuff!

Look, in the future, Python/Pandas may not even remain a popular language. If you observe the past history, you will see that programming languages are constantly replaced by newer, better languages. So forget trying to learn every detail of the language- it is a fool's errand.

Instead, in this "Pandas by Example" repository, I am going to: (1) create a file with a generic name, "How to drop one or more columns". It is generic because dropping a column is not specific to Pandas- it can be done in Excel, or Scala, or any language which deals with spreadsheets. (2) give concrete, self-written Jupyter notebook examples for it. So that in the future, you can quickly refer to this code if you want to do something.
