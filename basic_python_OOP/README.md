I feel that in order to really become good at using Python's various libraries (NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, pandas, scikit-learn, etc), I need to first learn the basic OOP concepts of Python. I am using Dusty Phillip's book, "Python 3 Object Oriented Programming"

First and foremost, learn the core OOP terms and concepts (objects, classes, attributes, methods, modules, packages, constructors). These are the bread-and-butter of OOP.
